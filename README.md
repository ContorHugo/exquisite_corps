His life was peaceful yet he craved adventure.  
One morning, a bird flew through his kitchen window, a letter hanging from his fluffy white neck.*

The letter seemed to have a royal stamp, which was strange as Gregor as a farmer never had contact with *the Queen*.  
With his knife, his wife gifted him for his previous birthday, he opened the letter.  
The letter started as followed :

* **If you receive this letter, this means you are the chosen one**
